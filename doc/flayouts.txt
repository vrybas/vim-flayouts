INTRODUCTION                                    *flayouts*

Flayouts.vim aims to ease work with [Fugitive](github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive)
by providing window layouts for certain operations, such as:

  * Commit
  * Pull Request review
  * Conflict Resolution

COMMANDS                                        *flayouts-commands*


                                                *flayouts-:Glstatus*
:Glstatus             Open new tab with three-window layout. Top window
                      contains `:Gstatus`, bottom window contains current
                      file, right window contains output of git-diff.

                                                *flayouts-:Glcommit*
:Glcommit             Perform a commit from *:Glstatus* window, and close tab.

                                                *flayouts-:Glabort*
:Glabort              Cancel a commit from *:Glstatus* window, and close tab.

                                                *flayouts-:Glc*
:Glc                  If executed from :Glstatus window, runs :Glcommit.
                      Otherwise, runs :Glstatus. So a single key mapping can
                      show status, and perform a commit.

                                                *flayouts-:GlpullRequest*
:GlpullRequest        Open new tab with two-window layout. Left window contains
                      current file, right window contains git-request-pull
                      output (summary of all commits between base branch and
                      current branch). Base branch can be specified as a
                      parameter (:GlpullRequest origin/develop), or with
                      global configuration variable `g:flayouts_base_branch`

                                                *flayouts-:GlresolveConflict*
:GlresolveConflict    Open new tab with three-window layout. Top window
                      conains 'ours' version of current file. Middle window
                      contains current file with conflict maks. Bottom window
                      contains 'theirs' version of current file.

                                                *flayouts-:GlprDiff*
:GlprDiff             Generate output of 'git-request-pull' into a temp file,
                      and show this temp file in current window.
                      Base branch can be specified as a parameter
                      (:GlprDiff origin/develop), or with global configuration
                      variable `g:flayouts_base_branch`

                                                *flayouts-:GlopenFromDiff*
:GlopenFromDiff       Open file containing code chunk under cursor from any
                      generated 'diff' output, and run `:Gblame`. Especially
                      useful from `:GlpullRequest` tab.

                                                *flayouts-:GllogPatch*
:GllogPatch           Open 'git log --patch' of current file in new tab. Or,
                      if run from any generated diff, will run
                      'git log --patch' on file, containing code chunk under
                      cursor and show in horizontal split.

                                                *flayouts-:GllogPatchDiff*
:GllogPatchDiff       Generate output of 'git log --patch' of current file
                      into a temp file, and show this temp file in current
                      window.
